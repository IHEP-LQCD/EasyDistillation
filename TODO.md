# TODO list

- [ ] Make all API consistent.
- [ ] Use a log system. `logging` should be fine.
- [ ] Use group theory to do the product.
- [x] 2-particle correlation function. Including P, D, ... wave.
- [ ] Integrate PyQuda to calculate perambulator.
- [ ] Integrate PyQuda to calculate sequencial source.
- [x] 3-point function. Need a representation for quark contration diagram.
- [ ] Helicity operator. Should this be considered?
